step for using Algorithm comparison.c:
1.open it by Dev C++ 5.5.3
2.compile and get the .exe for test 
3.In console, after "please input power n(within unsigned int):" the program automatically input a n ended from a file by an Enter
Then, after "please input iteration time k(within unsigned int) for Algorithm1, Algorithm2-iterative, Algorithm2-recursive respectively:",
the program automatically input 3 k from a file for each algorithm, 3 k are seperated by a space and after inputing last k, input an Enter to end the input.
4.The program will print the test result.
DO REMEMBER:if you want to get resonable result in appropriate time, do not input k/n too small or too large!
5.the zip test is an exe for testing
6. testdata.txt contains testing data for final.
binary_search.txt contains testing data for binary_search.

the binary_search.c can be used as above.


/*
some extra examples for my testing data for final:

n: 1024
k[]: 10500, 1008900, 1008900
