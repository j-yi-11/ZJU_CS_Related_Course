1. Starting with an empty splay tree, if we performance n consecutive insertions, the total cost is O(nlogn) even in the worst case.
2. A binomial queue with 31 keys may consists of 6 binomial trees.
3. Consdier the activity selection (interval scheduling) problem. In class, we have proved that an optimal solution can be obtained by selecting the activities in increasing order of thier finishing time. We can also obtain an optimal solution by selecting the activities in decreasing order of their start time.
4. In class we have proved that the Σ-tree generated by Huffman’s greedy algorithm must be optimal. Note that the optimal Σ-tree is not unique. Is it true that every optimal Σ-tree can be generated by the Huffman’s greedy algorithm?
5. Consider the O(nlogn)-time algorithm for the closest pair problem. Let $\delta=d(p_1,p_2)$ where $(p_1,p_2)$ is the closest pair among the left pairs and the right pairs. Suppose that the ClosestSplitPair subroutine returns a pair $(p_{1}^{s},p_{2}^{s})$. If $(p_{1}^{s},p_{2}^{s})<\delta $, $(p_{1}^{s},p_{2}^{s})$must be the closest split pair.

B.The knapsack problem can be solve in (nV) time where n is the number of items and V is the total value of items.
C.The knapsack problem can be solved by greedily selecting items according to their values.
D.The knapsack problem can be solved by greedily selecting items according to their efficiencies (the ratio of value to weight wi/v 
i).
14. 7-1 Find More Coins
Eva loves to collect coins from all over the universe, including some other planets like Mars. One day she visited a universal shopping mall which could accept all kinds of coins as payments. However, there was a special requirement of the payment: for each bill, she must pay the exact amount. Since she has as many as 10 
4
  coins with her, she definitely needs your help. You are supposed to tell her, for any given amount of money, whether or not she can find some coins to pay for it.

Input Specification:
Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line contains 2 positive numbers: N (≤10 
4
 , the total number of coins) and M (≤10 
2
 , the amount of money Eva has to pay). The second line contains N face values of the coins, which are all positive numbers. All the numbers in a line are separated by a space.

Output Specification:
For each test case, print in one line the face values V 
1
​
 ≤V 
2
​
 ≤⋯≤V 
k
​
  such that V 
1
​
 +V

​

k
​
 =M. All the numbers must be separated by a space, and there must be no extra space at the end of the line. If such a solution is not unique, output the smallest sequence. If there is no solution, output "No Solution" instead.

Note: sequence {A[1], A[2], ...} is said to be "smaller" than sequence {B[1], B[2], ...} if there exists k≥1 such that A[i]=B[i] for all i<k, and A[k] < B[k].
